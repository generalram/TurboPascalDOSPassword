TurboPascalDOSPassword
======================


Using Turbo Pascal 3.0 I was able to protect my DOS bootable disks by compiling this source code into password.com and then insert it into the autoexec.bat file of the DOS boot floppy.

If a correct password was not given, it would go into an infinate loop that crashed the stack and forced the machine to be reboot.

I had a lot of people steal my DOS boot disks in high school, and so this program was written in 1985 to prevent my boot disks from being stolen.

I had more Turbo Pascal examples but due to bitrot lost them on floppy disks.

I wanted to show how it was done back in the 1980's to protect your system before there was a password option for DOS or Windows.
